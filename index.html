Since its establishment, the variety of species has reduced to about 100 due to natural selection and management decisions, including the removal of the fast-growing legume tree Leucaena leucocephala to allow other species to flourish. Research in the biome focuses on how tropical plants interact with the atmosphere and water, particularly under changing conditions, providing insights into climate change impacts on ecosystems. The rainforest is divided into habitats such as lowland rainforest with large trees, terraces with small trees and crops, a ginger belt, a bamboo belt, an Amazonian floodplain analog, and a tepui cloud forest that has evolved into a marsh. The biome's soils are engineered and vary in texture, with a topsoil layer generally under one meter thick, supporting the diverse plant life and a few animal species, mostly insects.", imageUrl: 'rainforest.jpg' },
            { name: 'Human Habitat', text: "In the early 1990s, Biosphere 2 in Oracle, Arizona, served as an experimental ecological enclosure where the original crew, known as 'Biospherians', lived for two years in a self-sustaining habitat. Their accommodations were minimalist and functional, with private quarters akin to small dorm rooms, and communal spaces including a kitchen, dining area, and lounge to support a sense of community. The kitchen, relying on crops grown within Biosphere 2, necessitated culinary creativity, and the bathroom facilities featured composting toilets to conserve water. Work areas were dedicated to managing the internal biomes and scientific research, while advanced utility systems supported sustainability with features like energy-efficient lighting and water recycling. Despite space constraints, psychological well-being was addressed by incorporating aesthetic elements such as natural light, an art gallery, and a library, highlighting the endeavor to balance functionality with quality of life in this unprecedented closed-system environment.", imageUrl: 'human.jpg' },
            { name: 'Leo', text: "Understanding the process interactions and feedbacks among water, porous geological media, microbes, and vascular plants, is crucial for improving predictions of the response of Earthâ€™s critical zone to future climatic conditions. However, the integrated coevolution of landscapes under change, is notoriously difficult to investigate. Laboratory studies are limited in spatial and temporal scale, while field studies lack observational density and control. To bridge the gap between controlled laboratory and uncontrolled field studies, the University of Arizona built a macrocosm experiment of unprecedented scale: The Landscape Evolution Observatory (LEO) at Biosphere 2. Initial sensor, sampler, and soil-coring data, are providing insights into the linkages between water flow, weathering, and biological community development. These interacting processes drive the model systems to increasingly complex states, potentially perturbed by changes in climatic forcing. By intensively monitoring the evolutionary trajectory, integrating data with mathematical models, and fostering community-wide collaborations, we envision that emergent landscape structures and functions are linked and as significant progress emerges, LEO operations predict the coupled hydro-biogeochemical and ecological responses to global change.", imageUrl: 'leo.jpg' },
            { name: 'Desert', text: "The Biosphere 2's desert biome, initially designed to emulate a desert scrub ecosystem with a coastal climate pattern of erratic winter rain and summer drought, faced challenges when higher than anticipated rainfall and low evapotranspiration led to denser vegetation and grass invasion. In response, management shifted in 1994 towards a Mediterranean scrub woodland before changing again to foster more arid conditions. Efforts are now focused on promoting arid-adapted plant species and reducing grass species that utilize C4 photosynthesis. The biome's soils were engineered to reflect the diversity found in arid regions, from dune sand to clay-rich profiles, with features like mini-rhizotron tubes for observing underground activity and a playa for seasonal salt accumulation, which is now dominated by saltbushes. An artificial tinaja provides a habitat for freshwater species. Over time, plant diversity has diminished due to changes in management and climate, the absence of pollinating insects, and increased extinction rates.", imageUrl: 'desert.jpg' },
            { name: 'Savannah', text: "Biosphere 2's savanna biome served as a hydrological buffer between the desert and rainforest areas, aiming to replicate the atmospheric chemistry balancing act seen in real-world tropical savannas. This biome also focused on integrating biodiversity and aesthetic elements of savannas through its diverse vegetation zones planted with edible species for various animals. The savanna itself was structured into four distinct regions: the Quartzite Slope with its waterfall, the Upper Savanna with its fresh-water wetland species and gallery forest, the billabongs designed to mimic hyperseasonal environments, and the grass-dominated Lower Savanna adjacent to the Upper thornscrub. Each region was carefully designed to reflect different aspects of savanna ecosystems, from water management to plant diversity, catering to both ecological research and the needs of species within the biome.", imageUrl: 'savannah.jpg' },
            { name: 'Mangroves', text: "The Mangrove mesocosm, covering 441 m2, is a meticulously constructed estuarine model simulating two primary wetland habitats: marshes and forested swamps, the latter constituting 80% of the area with 542 mangroves and 15 freshwater trees. Composed of six connected sections, each featuring distinct community types to promote biodiversity, the mesocosm includes barriers reinforced with steel rebar and notches to allow water and animal movement. Key ecosystems within the model include a wetland-encircled Freshwater Pond, an Oligohaline marsh acting as a transitional zone, a Salt Marsh/White Mangrove section marking the marine area's beginning, followed by a Black Mangrove section, and finally, the northern sections, Oyster Bay and Fringing Red Mangrove. Initially, the mesocosm supported a variety of fauna, such as crawfish, snails, and various fish and crustaceans, but it has since experienced a decrease in faunal diversity, potentially due to the effects of biotic closure and the lack of tidal influence.", imageUrl: 'mangroves.png' },
            { name: 'Ocean', text: "The Biosphere 2 Marine Mesocosm, the world's largest enclosed ocean system, has been employed for critical research in coral reef resilience. Mimicking a Caribbean reef, it provides a controlled environment with customizable physical and chemical parameters to study coral responses to changing conditions. Notably, Columbia University used the mesocosm in 1996 for a pivotal study on photosynthesis and calcification under past, present, and predicted future CO2 conditions, finding a significant decline in coral calcification expected by mid-century. Despite subsequent neglect and ecosystem degradation, efforts are currently underway to revitalize the Ocean, reconstructing a diverse coral reef ecosystem to further explore and develop methods for reef restoration on a global scale, supported by advanced life support systems.", imageUrl: 'ocean.jpeg' },

It addresses climate vulnerabilities by reducing plant stress through PV shade, enhancing PV efficiency, and minimizing water use. Arizona's adoption of agrivoltaics could mitigate a projected loss of 1/3 of its irrigated agriculture due to water scarcity. Our plan aims to expand agrivoltaic research, understand its impacts across climates, integrate water purification systems, and link research to socio-political science and education to build resilience.",
